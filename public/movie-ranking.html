<h3>Ranking of kings</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. I love the characters and the pacing of the story</p>
<h3>Devil crybaby</h3>
<p>A pretty brutal anime, but nothing has made me feel in such a way</p>
<h3>Nomadland</h3>
<p>A mock documentary, but based on a real account. Looks into the travelling community around the US</p>
